# AES-Encryption
Rebuild of the AES algorithm from the ground up

**NOTE:** This may not be correct or clean code. 

The intention of this was to learn about the Advanced Encryption Algorithm by rebuilding it.
Therefore, it may not be efficient or accurate enough to use in real applications.

**ALSO NOTE:** Since the repo is currently still under developement, the code does not allow for decryption, only encryption. The README will be updated along with the code when that is implemented.

## Usage
`driver.py` is the tester, which has a simple string token/message encryption.

Run `python3 driver.py` within the repo and you'll be set.
